      <h1 id="Krivin">Peacock's Tail.</h1>
      <p> Once I came across <id class="special">Felix Krivin</id>'s book "Peacock's tail". It took the author 6 years during 1980s to write the book that gathered several satirical texts and reveals his sense of humour. He often emphasised the importance of humour in a not so easy life, as a method of survival. I like his puns, simple parallels, linguistical notes and outputs. It is easy to get acquainted with the author if you know Russian, but you can get only a smidgen of information in English. That is why I would like to present some of his wits that may arouse your interest. He is really worth reading.

      <div class="quote wealth">
        <h2 id="possesions"> The wealth of poverty </h2>
     <p> An Egyptian lady of pleasure Rhodopis, was selling her love for money to a king, and for wit to Aesopian.</p>
     <p> Some pay by wit for love, others – by love for wit. And only those, who haven't got anything to pay, use money.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote wealth">
        <h2>Property</h2>
     <p>A person, together with the stuff he posses, makes an organic whole. That is why, the more he owns, the less part of the organic whole he is.</p>
     <p>And after a certain grade he turns into a possession of that, which was his stuff before.</p>

      <div class="quote armours">
        <h2 id="values"> Don Quixote's Armours </h2>
     <p>Don Quixote decides for armours in a choice between armours or success.</p>
     <p> The majority decides for success, because armours haven't been in for a long period of time. </P>
     <p> The fashion for amours is usually out, or is not in at the time. </p>
     <p> The fashion for success always continues to exist.</p>

     <div class="quote obstacles armours">
  <h2> Life with obstacles </h2>
    <p> Life is a race with obstacles.</p>
    <p> After that – a pace with obstacles.</p>
    <p> Later – a slow pace with obstacles.</P>
    <p> The tempo of movements changes, however, obstacles remain.</p>

<div class="nature">
  <div class="quote one natur">
<h2 id="nature"> Woodland scenery</h2>
     <p> Once upon a time trees gathered together in forests, as if in regiments  in order to conquer the Earth. But now they are shrinking, huddling up together in panic in order to find salvation... </p>
</div>
  <div class="quote mother natur">
<h2> Mother Nature </h2>
  <p>A human being calls the Nature not mom, but mother, because he considers himself as an adult. And for a long time he doesn't ask the Nature: Mom, may I? Mom, shall I?, but says: So will it be, Mother. You don't understand it, that must be so.</p> 
  <p>Why then is he crying now "Mom!" as he used to cry in his childhood?</p>
  <p>But the Nature doesn't hear him. It is deaf after his loud deals, loud phrases, and  it has no strength to be a mom any more... </p>

<div class="literature">
  <div class="quote master">
<h2 id="heroes"> The Master and Margarita </h2>
  <p>Goethe named his tragedy after the hero, as the hero, the creator with his search for an eternal youth was important for him. Goethe lived long and relatively trouble-free, only youth lacked.</p> 
  <p>Much lacked Bulgakov, and he positioned in the centre  not a seeker, but a seekee – Margarita. That is why he gave a name to Margarita, but the Master was left without one. It is not the person, who is important, rather something he is striving to, his love is important. Not youth, but love.</p>
  <p>According to Goethe youth gives birth to love. According to Bulgakov love gives birth to youth.</p> 
  <p>According to Goethe the most difficult and important way is the way to youth, and then love is then a stone's throw away.</p> 
  <p>According to Bulgakov the most important way is the way to love, and the youth is then a stone's throw away. </p>
</div>
<div class="quote king master">
<h2> King and Fool </h2>
  <p> In “King Lear” the fool is an antipode of the king. Common sense covered by insanity, the antipode to insanity covered by common sense.</p>
  <p>But when the king's insanity becomes clear, the fool proves to be needless. And in the last two acts he is absent.</p> 
  <p>Shakespearean scholars consider the fool's disappearance   a mystery. But he is just unnecessary. What for are two fools in the tragedy?</p>
  <p>However, it is just an illusion, that the fool has disappeared. It is the king who has disappeared.</p> 
  <p>Although he is presented on a stage, but he continues the line of the fool, not the king.</p> 
  <p>The line of insanity, performed by common sense. </p>

<div class="satire">
   <div class="quote struggle opposites">
  <h2 id="satire"> The struggle of opposites </h2>
     <p> Some use laughter to destroy fear, others use fear to destroy laughter. That is why neither laughter nor fear decreases in the world.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="quote pluses opposites">
  <h2> Satire's pluses </h2>
     <p> Over-cross a minus and it will turn into a plus.</p>
     <p>That is what satire does: all its pluses are from our minuses. </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="quote Laughable">
   <h2>Laughable Great and nominal unlaughable.</h2>
  <p>In the same year, in the same month, with difference of several days, two babies were born – Charlie and Adolf.</p>
  <p>The future Chaplin and Hitler.</p>
  <p>A genius comic actor and a mediocre lance-corporal, making a claim for superiority. A genius in a role of a small person and a small person in a role of a genius.</p> 
  <p>During many years they were tracing one another.</p>
  <p>They were in a struggle. However, using different means. One used all types of weapon, the other used only one weapon – laughter.</p>
  <p>“Dictators are laughable. My goal – make the public to laugh over them”.</p>
  <p>Georges Sadoul remembered this saying of Chaplin and corrected it a little bit: “dictators are also laughable”.</p> 
  <p>If only they were only laughable. There would be nobody but dictators the most pleasant on the earth.</p> 
  <p>But dictators have also a flaw: they are afraid to look laughable. That is why they don't bare laughing faces: it seems them,that they are laughed over.</p>
  <p>Derided dictator took severe measures, to make Chaplin stop speaking. Maybe, he was humiliated that he was named not Adolf but Adenoid in the film “Great dictator”, making a hint that he prevents people from breathing.</p>
  <p>Dictators have always prevented people from breathing, but laughter has always helped to clean throats. </p>
